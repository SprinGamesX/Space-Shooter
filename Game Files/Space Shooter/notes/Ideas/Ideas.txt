Enemies (Elites and bosses):

Enemies should have 4 kinds of possible attacks
1. Summon
2. Move
3. Area attacks
4. Complicated attacks (Show warnings)

Enemies will additionally have a data file (similar to ships) that contains all their: 
- attacks
- cooldowns
- stats
- weaknesses
- resistances

bosses and elites will have their HP/toughness bars drawn on the top of the screen by the GameManager (up to 4 bars will fit and bosses will have custom bars)

Smaller enemies:
Summons will have their own stats and will deal damage based on themselves
Summons will also have their own weaknesses and ressistances but will not have attacks or cooldowns, instead they will have types of movements (such as Linear, curved, still, etc)

Projectiles will not have their own stats and will either be one shot (by ships) or unhitable

Element stuff

Elemental Accumilation
each element accumilates to 250 (50 on small enemies) and when it does it will trigger an effect like DOT/explosion/freeze etc

Effects:
ICE - Cryoarrested - Freezes the target for 5 seconds and causes it to have its ICE RES reduced by 5% for the rest of the battle (Stacks up to 10 stacks)
FIRE - Volatogenic - Adds a stack of EXPLOSIVE to the target, upon death the target will explode (Explosion radius depends on EXPLOSIVE stacks, EXPLOSIVE can stack up to 50 stacks)
LIFE - Germinative -Heals all ships for a certain amount depending on the ship's ES
VENOM - Incised - Applies a DoT to the target and reducing its ATK and SPD by 20% for 10s
LIGHTNING - Electrostruck - Applies SHOCKED to the target, when SHOCKED each time the target is hit it will also attack nearby enemies, this lasts for 15s and the radius depends on the ship's ES
STEEL - Fractured - Deplete's 25% of the enemies TOUGHNESS and reduces their DEF by 50% for 10s (unstackable)
QUANTUM - Decoherence - Deals Damage equal to 1% of the target's base HP and has a chance of 50% to teleport the enemy(small) back to a random location

Enemies of the same element will be completely immune to elemental accumilation
Elemental accumilation will accumilate faster depending on the ship's Elemental Specialty

DoT:

Idea 1:

Type 1: Damage over Time

This type of DoT deals damage based on time passed and it will decrease in stacks once it deals damage, when reaching 0 stacks
it will remove itself from its target, it will deal damage based on the multipliar it is given

Type 2: Extra hit damage
This type of DoT deals additional damage each time the target is hit, each hit decreases its stacks and once it reaches 0 stacks it removes itself
it will deal damage based on the multiplier it is given


Type 3: Presistant Damage over Time

This type of DoT deals damage based on time passed and it will have a time limit , when the time is up
it will remove itself from its target, it will deal damage based on the multipliar it is given and the amount of stacks

Type 4: Presistant Extra hit damage
This type of DoT deals additional damage each time the target is hit, it will also have a time limit, once time is up it removes itself
it will deal damage based on the multiplier it is given and the amount of stacks

for types 3 and 4:
when reapplied while still active it will regain time equal to the amount of stacks it can hold:
for example if it lasts for 10 seconds and has 10 stacks, each instance will restore 1 second to the effect


Endless Mode:

Endless Mode will be a series of battles of different sorts that will play out one after another without breaks
it will ramp up in difficulty depending on the amount of waves defeated

Challenges:
Elite - kill a mini-boss enemy
Defend - Defend a target from normal/small enemies
Double up - Kill 2 mini bosses
Boss - Kill boss enemy

Explore Mode:
