Elemental Overload is triggered when the enemy's [Elemental Accumulation] reaches 250 on [Elite Enemies] and 50 on [Normal Enemies].

# Elemental Accumulation
Elemental Accumulation is a meter of sorts that all enemies have and is separate for each element, when an enemy is hit enough times by elemental attacks it will trigger an [Elemental Overload].

# Types of Elemental Overload:

## Freeze
Freeze is the Ice [Elemental Overload], it causes the enemy to freeze for 5 seconds and have its Ice Resistance reduced by 5% permanently.
This effect can stack up to 10 stacks, meaning at max stacks it will reduce the enemy's Ice Resistance by 50%.
Additionally the amount of time the enemy is frozen for increases based on [Elemental Specialty]

## Ignite
Ignite is the Fire [Elemental Overload], each time Ignite is triggered it will apply the enemy with a stack of [Explosive] 
If an enemy has at least 1 stack of [Explosive] it will explode upon dying.

#### Explosive
A status effect that can be applied from [Ignite], Explosive stacks up to 50 and increases its effects based on the amount of stacks.
Explosive DMG will increase based on the ship's [Elemental Specialty] 

## Bloom
Bloom is the Life [Elemental Overload], once triggered it will heal all allies based on the amount of [Elemental Specialty] of the ship that triggered the overload.

## Corrupt
Corrupt is the Venom [Elemental Overload], once triggered the enemy will be effected by 3 negative status effects:
1. A [Damage Over Time] effect will be applied that deals damage based on the ship's [Elemental Specialty], this effect will apply a number of stacks equal to the amount of Venom ships on the team:
   1 ship = 1 stack
   2 ships = 3 stacks
   3 ships = 8 stacks
2. ATK -20% for 10s
3. SPD -20% for 10s

## Surge
Surge is the Lightning [Elemental Overload], when an enemy is shocked it will take additional damage each time it is hit, this damage will scale based on the ship's [Elemental Specialty] and ATK.

## Fracture
Fracture is the Steel [Elemental Overload], triggering Fracture will instantly reduce the enemy's [[Elemental Shields and Breaks#Elemental Shield|Elemental Shield]] by 15% even if the enemy is not weak to Steel, if an enemy is already [[Elemental Shields and Breaks#Break|Broken]] reduce its DEF by 50% for 10s

## Distort
Distort is the Quantum [Elemental Overload], triggering Distort will cause small enemies to reverse their trajectory and [Elite Enemies] will take damage equal to â€‹1-5% of their max HP and if they are currently attacking, **the attack will immediately end**.
